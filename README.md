### Introduction

[Dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is
an [inversion of control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) technique wherein you delegate
instantiation of dependencies to the IoC container, instead of doing it in your own code imperatively.

There are many advantages to using dependency injection, but doing so manually often leads to a large amount of
boilerplate code to be written. **Erange** is a framework that makes it possible to write code that uses dependency
injection without the hassle of writing much of that boilerplate code.

If I've already captured your attention, then I invite you to proceed to
the [documentation](https://github.com/arklanq/erange/wiki), where you'll delve deeper into both the topic of the
presented concepts and the Erange library itself.
